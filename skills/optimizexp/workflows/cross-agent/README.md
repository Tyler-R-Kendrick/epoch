# Cross-agent deterministic runner

For hosts without native workflows (or as a scoring co-processor for all hosts).

```bash
node --import tsx skills/optimizexp/workflows/cross-agent/review-loop.mts --help
# without installed deps:
node --experimental-strip-types skills/optimizexp/workflows/cross-agent/review-loop.mts --help
```

Modes: `init` | `status` | `should-stop` | `equilibrium` | `assert-complete` | `mark-complete` | `validate-bus` | `read-bus` | `aggregate-bus` | `score` | `plateau`.

**Completion:** only `assert-complete` exit 0 + `mark-complete` ends an invocation. `should-stop` plateau is cycleStop only.

Optional WDK notes: `../../references/cross-agent/vercel-wdk.md`.
Plain runner has **zero** extra dependencies beyond repo `tsx`.
