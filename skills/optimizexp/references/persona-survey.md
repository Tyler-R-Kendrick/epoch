# Persona survey (end of run)

When a run finishes Phase 1 (metrics-zero **or** irreducible) — and again after Phase 2 if delight ran — poll each **active persona** in a **pseudo survey**. Personas answer **in character** from evidence + bus feelings, not as the coding agent.

Default: **on**. Opt out: **`--no-survey`** / `OPTIMIZEXP_NO_SURVEY=1`.

## Purpose

1. Capture **qualitative feedback** that numeric harm scores miss.
2. Score **positive metrics** (excitement, easeOfUse, perceivedOptimality) per persona × surface.
3. Turn free-text answers into **pseudo feature requests**.
4. Feed **experiment backlog** ranking (`experiment-backlog.md`).

## When to run

| Phase 1 stop | Survey? | Delight phase? |
|---|---|---|
| `metrics-zero` | **Yes** (required unless `--no-survey`) | Yes (unless `--no-delight`) |
| `irreducible` (residual harm > 0) | **Yes** | No (positives advisory only) |
| `passes-cap` / blocked / user / safety | **Yes** if any cells were measured | No (or only if primary already 0) |
| `--report-only` | Yes (measure-only; no uplift apply) | Score only |

Survey is **write-once per persona per run** (overwrite allowed only if re-running the whole end sequence).

## Locations

```text
.optimizexp/runs/<run-id>/survey/
  <persona-id>.json           # one response file per persona
  aggregate.json              # rollup + extracted featureRequests
.optimizexp/bus/entries/
  <iso>-<seq>-survey.json     # optional bus mirror (kind: survey)
```

## Pseudo survey form (fixed questions)

Agents **must** use this instrument (can add optional free-text only under `extraQuestions`):

| Id | Prompt | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `q_excitement` | On a scale of 0–5, how **excited** are you to use this path again? Why? | excitement + rationale |
| `q_ease` | On a scale of 0–5, how **easy** was the happy path? What still felt heavier than it should? | easeOfUse |
| `q_optimal` | On a scale of 0–5, how **optimal** does this feel vs how it *should* work? What is missing? | perceivedOptimality |
| `q_delight` | What, if anything, **delighted** you? | featureRequests (keep/amplify) |
| `q_friction_feel` | Even if nothing “broke,” what felt **annoying or dull**? | featureRequests (fix/uplift) |
| `q_one_change` | If you could demand **one change** next week, what is it? | top featureRequest |
| `q_never` | What should we **never** do on this path? | harms guardrails / anti-goals |
| `q_recommend` | Would you recommend this experience to a peer? (yes/mixed/no + why) | desirability alignment |

Answers are **first person as the persona**. Cite evidence paths when visual/CLI transcript informed the score.

### Rules

1. **`positive` scores** must match `q_excitement` / `q_ease` / `q_optimal` integer answers.
2. **At least one** `featureRequest` when any positive score ≤ 3 **or** `q_one_change` is non-empty.
3. Feature requests are **pseudo product requests** — not Linear issues yet. Downstream: backlog ranking, then optional `sdlc` / improve.
4. **Never invent** secrets, credentials, or live third-party calls as the requested change.
5. Bus feelings/desirability from the run **inform** answers; they do not replace the survey instrument.

## Aggregate

```bash
node --import tsx skills/optimizexp/harness/survey.mts \
  --mode aggregate --run <runId>
```

Writes `survey/aggregate.json`:

- mean/min positive metrics across personas
- flat list of `featureRequests`
- recommended backlog order (pre-rank)

## Bus kind `survey` (optional)

```json
{
  "kind": "survey",
  "id": "2026-07-31T16:00:00Z-9901-survey",
  "runId": "…",
  "persona": "product-app-developer",
  "path": ".optimizexp/runs/…/survey/product-app-developer.json",
  "positive": { "…": "…" },
  "featureRequestCount": 1
}
```

`validate-bus` accepts `kind: survey` without full expect/act scorecards.

## Agent procedure (end of invocation)

1. List personas in `scope.json` / measured cells.
2. For each persona, write `survey/<persona>.json` from evidence + bus.
3. `survey.mts --mode aggregate --run <id>`.
4. `survey.mts --mode rank-backlog --run <id>` (updates `runs/<id>/backlog.json` + merges `.optimizexp/backlog/experiments.json`).
5. If Phase 2 active and not report-only: apply top S/M uplift from backlog.
6. Summarize survey themes + top 5 backlog items in `summary.md`.
