# AX — host agents & config

## Host matrix

| Host | Skills tree | MCP config | Plugins | Subagents |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills` | `.mcp.json` | `.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/agents/` |
| Cursor | `.agents/skills` | `.cursor/mcp.json` | rules | — |
| Codex | `.agents/skills` | `~/.codex/config.toml` | marketplace (machine) | — |
| Grok Build | `.grok/skills` | MCP via product | workflows | subagent tool |
| Copilot CLI | limited | — | marketplace | — |

Restore shared harness skills (gitignored trees) with `npm run agents:install-skills`
(anti-slop) plus `npx impeccable install` / higgsfield `skills add` as documented in
`AGENTS.md` and [`docs/anti-slop.md`](../../../../docs/anti-slop.md).

CLI ergonomics and repo scripts: [harness-clis.md](harness-clis.md).
MCP detail: [mcp.md](mcp.md).

## Subagents (Claude Code backend for sdlc)

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| `implementer` | One issue, worktree, TDD, incremental commits, `.sdlc/report.json` |
| `reviewer` | Read-only re-run gates + acceptance checklist |

Same one-shot issue contract for cloud coding agents (handback `sdlc-report` fence).

## CLI ergonomics to score

- Help text discoverable (`--help`, consistent verbs)
- Non-zero exit on failure; machine-readable modes when claimed
- Auth errors distinguish “not logged in” vs “forbidden”
- Setup script documents exact install commands per host
- Codex global paste documented; project `.codex/config.toml` is the template

## Friction smells

- Per-machine plugin install with no script path
- Agent-specific features undocumented for other hosts
- Subagent prompts omit hard rules (secrets, no shared files, staged agent:check)
- Opening the repo auto-starts keyful MCP without decline guidance

## Optimization moves

1. Shared setup: `scripts/setup-agent-tools.sh --agent <name> --no-gbrain`
2. Shared MCP launchers referenced from every host config
3. Document resume/reconcile (sdlc dispatch)
4. Superpowers: note skills load at **session start**
5. Keep host matrix in AGENTS + this file aligned
