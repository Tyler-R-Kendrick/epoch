# AX — agent skills

## Anatomy

```text
SKILL.md                 # frontmatter + thin steps
references/              # progressive disclosure (sectioned for AX under optimizexp/ax/)
workflows/               # optional host workflows
scripts/ / harness/      # deterministic helpers
```

## HoBo rules

- Mirror `.agents/skills/<name>` ↔ `.claude/skills/<name>` (byte-identical)
- `pnpm run skills:mirror-check`
- OKF frontmatter on reference concepts for `repo` / `draft` / `sdlc` / `optimizexp`
- Codex-valid YAML frontmatter on `SKILL.md`
- Progressive disclosure: load references by **branch/section**, not all at once
- optimizexp discovery: **never** default primary-bind live egress scripts (`eval:agent:live`)

## Repo-local skills (high traffic)

| Skill | AX role |
|---|---|
| `repo` | Lifecycle, search-before-test, PR hygiene |
| `draft` | Proof taxonomy + artifact gates |
| `sdlc` | Full loop; `/sdlc --finish` session land |
| `optimizexp` | UX/DX/AX measure→reduce→verify |
| `gh-stack` | Non-interactive stacked PRs |

## Friction smells

- Skill body longer than needed; empty or missing `references/`
- Duplicate skills with different names across hosts
- Model-invoked description bloat (loaded every turn)
- Feature bindings to live evals for offline seeds
- Stale steps/README still advertising old primary commands

## Uncertainty smells

- Skill tells agent to run full monorepo tests as first step
- Conflicting instructions vs `AGENTS.md`
- Missing completion criteria → premature completion
- “Plateau” claimed while implementable S/M findings remain (optimizexp)

## Optimization moves

1. Thin SKILL.md; sectioned references (this AX tree is the template).
2. Mirror-check in agent:check when skills change.
3. code-discovery demotes live scripts; exp-proofs use classification path.
4. Keep feature `steps/README.md` primary binding in sync with `feature.json`.
5. Authoring: leading words, ladder, no-ops (writing-great-skills vocabulary).

## Evidence

- `pnpm run skills:mirror-check`
- Feature binding tests under `.optimizexp/features/*/test/`
- Diffs that remove live primaryCommands from offline features
