# AX — model routing

**Model routing** is which model/backend handles which class of work. Bad routing is an agent
experience defect: slow loops, surprise cost, or weak models on hard design tasks.

## Goals

- Cheap, fast models (or **no** model) for mechanical gates, format, search
- Stronger models for design, adversarial review, hard diagnosis
- Explicit opt-in for cloud backends that send code/prompts off-box

## Epoch anchors

| Path | Routing note |
|---|---|
| Local gates (`agent:check`, doctor, biome, tsc) | Prefer deterministic CLIs — **zero** model |
| `improve` plans | May use a capable model; output is markdown plans only |
| SkillOpt | Offline trainer; default sleep backend **mock** (no-spend); live backends opt-in |
| gbrain | Embedding provider when enabled — cost + egress (AUTH.md) |
| Cloud coding agents (sdlc dispatch) | Isolated issues; same one-shot contract as local implementers |
| Superpowers / brainstorming | Session skills; no required paid API for superpowers itself |

## Friction smells

- Running full monorepo `pnpm test` as first agent step “to understand the repo”
- Using a frontier model to reformat files a linter owns
- No documented “use mock / local” path for SkillOpt or evals
- Dispatch always picks the most expensive cloud agent for one-line docs

## Uncertainty smells

- Unclear which model a host will use for a subagent
- “eval:agent:live” as default feature binding (implies production spend)
- Missing cost/egress note next to model choice

## Harms smells

- Routing private code to a provider without consent or AUTH framing
- Training/eval loops that exfiltrate secrets in prompts

## Optimization moves

1. Performance-first ladder in AGENTS.md: search → narrow test → never broad discovery tests.
2. optimizexp discovery **never** primary-binds live egress scripts unless seed opts into live.
3. sdlc backend matrix: cloud for isolated issues; local worktrees for shared-file work.
4. Document model/backend in issue contracts when cost-sensitive.
5. Prefer deterministic harnesses (cucumber with mocks, vitest) over live LLM evals in default PR lanes.

## Score guidance

| Observation | Metrics |
|---|---|
| Default path requires live paid model | friction ≥ 3, uncertainty ≥ 2 |
| Secret or private corpus auto-sent to embedder | harms ≥ 3 |
| Clear local/mock path + expensive path labeled | friction ≤ 1 |
